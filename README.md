# C-211
Programs written for my C++ Object-Oriented Program class

These are the assignments for the class:

____________________________________________________________________
Assignment 1 - Perfect Square:

Write a program to find and print the first perfect square (i*i) whose last two digits
are both odd.

__________________________________________________________________
Assignment 2 - Equivalent Arrays:

Consider the two arrays a and b.
a: 1 2 3 4 5
b: 3 4 5 1 2

It is possible to transform array a into array b by right shifting each element of a to the “right”
three places. If an element “falls off” the back of the array have it come around the front and
keep counting positions. That is how 3 in array ended up in the first position of array b. One
way to look at this is to imagine that we are moving the element around in a circular manner.
In the example above, we have right shifted the array 3 positions to the right.
Definition: Let a and b be two integer arrays of the same length. We say that they are “shift
equivalent” if array a can be right shifted to create array b.

Problem:
Write a function: bool equivalent(int a[], int b[], int n)
which takes two arrays a and b of length n and returns true is they are shift equivalent and false
otherwise
